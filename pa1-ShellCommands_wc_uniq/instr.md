# Overview
This assignment serves as an introduction to programming in C. As the first assignment, the programs that you will write are smaller than you may be used to and smaller than what is to come. Take the opportunity to emphasize a focused understanding, to explore the use of new tools to aid in your programming, and to reinforce concepts from prior coursework and projects. Challenge yourself to develop a quality solution that goes beyond a solution that just works.
