# CSC357-SystemsProgramming
Professor Dr. Andrew Migler - Fall 2023

# About
This repository is dedicated to re-coding the big, key programming assignments from the course I took at Cal Poly SLO: Systems Programming.

# The Course
The course was extremely difficult but if you want to do well in this class then DO NOT procrastinate. Now, how do you do that? The day an assignment comes by, immediately start by planning out the assignment. Truly understand what is the expected output, what do you need to know from the shell (i.e. "man" pages of functions and C-specific behaviors), and the program flow from one point to another. Great people to ask about these are, quite obviously, the professor teaching the course and TA assisting in the course!!!

I have never felt so depressed about school from any course until this one when it dropped the second programming assignment which was continental distances ahead in difficulty from the first programming assignment. This was the one engineering course I stayed up two nights just reading the instructions to understand the assignment, not even coding anything. Don't underestimate what writing and drawing can do for you. Planning. Matters.

# Purpose
This course impacted me so much that I found the time to revisit my god-awful, extremely rushed, poorly-understood code and rewrite cleaner programs.
I hope my code only serves as a guideline or a small push for you to get back on track. Please don't copy my code, because I want you to learn the same lessons I did, and grow as a student and a programmer.

Once you finish this course, you're going to think "If I got through this, I can do anything"

# Contents
All the assignment pdf details, the code itself, the Makefiles, are pretty much all present.

# Other notes
Only Asgn4 is group work. Everything else is individual.
